# JacynoPOS

JacynoPOS is a point of sale system for restaurants aimed at working with small devices (like smartphones) and optionally printers.

## Getting Started

The application is still in early works and is not functional. It might have a lot of errors and glitches as well, or might not work at all.

### Installing

To install the application you will only need a PHP server with MySQL support, like xampp. All you need to do is allow mod_rewrite and put the project on your server. Then, you can access it by simply going to it's URL, for example

```
http://localhost/pos/
```

So far there is no built in CMS, so you need to manage everything from your database. You will need to set up a database for users and items, register an account and give it access of 1 or higher. Then you can log in using that account and play around with the POS.
